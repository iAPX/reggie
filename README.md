# Reggie

Regexp tool.
Regexp to structured language. Structured language to regexp. Unit tests.

I dislike regexp. In fact I hate that.<br/>
Unreadable. Impossible to maintain correctly. Complexity. In many cases used without sanity (numbers).<br/>
And by the way some popular regexp proved to be security holes with time...<br/>

How do I handle that?<br/>
By making regexp readable, testable and eventually useable.<br/>
